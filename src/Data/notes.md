## Notes about the data

The SVG map I am using doesn't have the following regions represented on it:

- Greater Manchester
- West Midlands
- Tyne and Wear
- Merseyside

These are thefore represented by the multiple regions that used to make up the region before it was created to accurately colour the map, the player will be assigned to all of the listed regions used as a replacement.

- Greater Manchester: [Lancashire, Cheshire]
- West Midlands [Staffordshire, Worcestershire and Warwickshire]
- Tyne and Wear [Northumberland]
- Merseyside [Lancashire, Cheshire]

All data is gathered using https://www.worldfootball.net/team_performance/ listed in the season the teams won. A player must have atleast 1 appearance to be added to the list
